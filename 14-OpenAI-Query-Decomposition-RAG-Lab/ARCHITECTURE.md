# OpenAI Query Decomposition RAG Lab Architecture

## Objective

Implement query decomposition for retrieval using the OpenAI Agents SDK, Azure AI Foundry, ChromaDB, and a dummy security runbook PDF.

This lab shows how a complex question can be split into smaller retrieval questions before synthesis.

## Problem Statement

Run the lab scenario and observe how the workflow components collaborate to produce the final result.

## File Responsibilities

- `.env`: Supports setup, configuration, reference, or documentation for the lab.
- `.env.example`: Supports setup, configuration, reference, or documentation for the lab.
- `lab_agents/__init__.py`: Keeps lab code separate from the installed `agents` SDK package.
- `lab_agents/decomposition_agent.py`: Defines and runs the SDK decomposition and synthesis agents with `Agent`, `Runner`, and structured output.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: Supports setup, configuration, reference, or documentation for the lab.
- `config/__init__.py`: Loads this lab local .env file and creates model, kernel, client, or tracing configuration.
- `config/settings.py`: Loads this lab's local `.env`, creates the embedding client, and configures an Azure-backed Agents SDK `RunConfig`.
- `data/pdfs/security_incident_runbook.pdf`: Contains local dummy knowledge-base source documents and PDFs.
- `data/source_docs/security_incident_runbook.txt`: Contains local dummy knowledge-base source documents and PDFs.
- `main.py`: Entry point that accepts input, runs the workflow, and prints the result.
- `models/__init__.py`: Defines data models or TypedDict state shared across the workflow.
- `models/rag_models.py`: Defines data models or TypedDict state shared across the workflow.
- `Reference.md`: Supports setup, configuration, reference, or documentation for the lab.
- `requirements.txt`: Supports setup, configuration, reference, or documentation for the lab.
- `services/__init__.py`: Contains reusable business logic, retrieval, telemetry, output, or external-service simulation.
- `services/chunking_service.py`: Contains reusable business logic, retrieval, telemetry, output, or external-service simulation.
- `services/embedding_service.py`: Contains reusable business logic, retrieval, telemetry, output, or external-service simulation.
- `services/pdf_service.py`: Contains reusable business logic, retrieval, telemetry, output, or external-service simulation.
- `services/rag_pipeline.py`: Contains reusable business logic, retrieval, telemetry, output, or external-service simulation.
- `services/vector_store_service.py`: Contains reusable business logic, retrieval, telemetry, output, or external-service simulation.
- `vector_store/`: Stores persisted ChromaDB vector index files.

## Test Prompts

Use these prompts to test the lab objective:

1. A suspicious login was followed by data export from a finance system. What should the response team do first, how should severity be assigned, and what evidence must be preserved?
2. A privileged user downloaded many HR files after a failed MFA challenge. What steps should responders take?
3. A malware alert appeared on a server that hosts customer exports. What should be contained and preserved?
4. A vendor VPN login from an unusual country accessed payroll records. What should be investigated?
5. A data loss alert fired after finance reports were emailed externally. What response workflow should be followed?

## How To Run

```bash
cd "14-OpenAI-Query-Decomposition-RAG-Lab"
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py
```
