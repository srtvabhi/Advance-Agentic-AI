# Lab 12: AutoGen Autonomous Task-Solving Ecosystem

## Objective

Create an autonomous task-solving agent ecosystem using AutoGen.

## Problem Statement

Investigate a payment API slowdown, open an incident, notify the team, analyze likely root cause, and prepare an update.

## Test Prompts

Use these prompts to test the lab objective:

1. The payment API is slow and customers are reporting checkout failures. Investigate, open an incident, notify the team, analyze cause, and prepare an update.
2. The HR portal login is failing for employees in one region. Coordinate investigation, support response, and stakeholder communication.
3. Finance dashboards are stale after a delayed data pipeline. Investigate the issue and prepare an operations update.
4. Customer support chat is timing out after a new release. Investigate the impact and prepare a recovery update.
5. Inventory sync is failing between ecommerce and warehouse systems. Analyze the issue and prepare an executive summary.

## How To Run

```bash
cd "12-AutoGen-Autonomous-Ecosystem-Lab"
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py
```
