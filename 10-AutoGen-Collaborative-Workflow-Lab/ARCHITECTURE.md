- `.env.example`: Supports setup, configuration, reference, or documentation for the lab.
- `agents/__init__.py`: Defines agent creation functions and role instructions.
- `agents/team_agents.py`: Defines agent creation functions and role instructions.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: Supports setup, configuration, reference, or documentation for the lab.
- `config/__init__.py`: Loads this lab local .env file and creates model, kernel, client, or tracing configuration.
- `config/settings.py`: Loads this lab local .env file and creates model, kernel, client, or tracing configuration.
- `main.py`: Entry point that accepts input, runs the workflow, and prints the result.
- `models/__init__.py`: Defines data models or TypedDict state shared across the workflow.
- `models/conversation_models.py`: Defines data models or TypedDict state shared across the workflow.
- `orchestration/__init__.py`: Builds the orchestration flow and connects agents or LangGraph nodes.

2. Create a multi-agent hospital appointment scheduling solution with privacy controls.
3. Design an insurance claim processing workflow with business, technical, security, and coordinator agents.
4. Create a procurement vendor onboarding workflow with security review.
5. Design a retail complaint resolution workflow across support, operations, and compliance.
